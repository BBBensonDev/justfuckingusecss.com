        <h1>Just fucking use CSS</h1>
        <p>
          Hey fucker, so you've read to
          <a href="https://justfuckingusehtml.com/">just fucking use HTML</a>,
          huh? You've taken that advice to heart and are still using Bootstrap,
          Bulma, Material whatchamicallit to style the damn thing? What a
          fucking joke. Yet another newsflash, asshole: The web also has this
          thing called <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>, or CSS if you don't want
          to remember three basic words. It does everything you could ever wish
          to style your loser website. <q>Oh but CSS is too hard!</q>, then give
          the fuck up on web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything was fine and fucking dandy when the web was using simple
          style sheets using CSS. Now designers demand us to use these overly
          complicated, hard to modify, painful to use tools called CSS
          frameworks. CSS came to the web in 1996, only a fucking year after
          HTML. Now you want us to ditch that for JavaScript automations, or
          half-assed style sheets?
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at this website, fucker, it's pretty as fuck, with 72 lines of
          CSS (not including the CSS reset). Seems like a lot, right? Wrong, you
          idiot.
        </p>

            >Better motherfucking website</a
          >
          did it in 7!
        </h2>
        <p>
          Seven fucking declarations to make something pretty as fuck. Guess
          what? I wanted to do more, just to show how lazy of a failure you
          really are. I am not the best at CSS by any means, yet I can make
          something that fucking funcitons, and looks beautiful. Look at these
          beautiful buttons I wrote by hand.
        </p>
        <div>
          <button
            class="btn btn-1"
            onclick="() => { console.log('Button clicked')}"
          >
            Regular button
          </button>
          <button
            class="btn btn-2"
            onclick="() => { console.log('Button clicked')}"
          >
            Outlined button
          </button>
        </div>
        <p>
          Five amazing buttons that you can do everything with.
          <q>Oh but... I don't want this to fuck up on other browsers!</q> Oh
          you dipshit, no one does. That's why you use shit like
          <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize"
            >Modern Normalize</a
          >, to give you a <em>reset</em>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>AI is bullshit.</h2>
        <p>
          Oh you want Tailwind because your precious little retard AI can do it
          all for you? Legitimately fuck off. If a computer (a literal rock with
          tiny lightning in it) is writing your websites for you, then why are
          you even doing web development? Money? Go get a damn job at McDonald's
          if you only want the damn money. It will make you more money than your
          stupid ass vibe coded startup anyhow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another fucking issue fuckface: AI can do plain CSS too. If you really
          want to be a degenerate, at least make it so your website isn't just
          fancy inline styles.
